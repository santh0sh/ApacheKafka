> Node where your Kafka is running is kafka brokers
> Atmoic unit of data is called Kakfa Message. it is array of byte. Raw form os storing any content. 
> Message will have mandatory data : Payload and a optional metadata (key). 


Kafka CLuster
	- Broker(s)
  	- Topic(s)
    	- Partion(s)
      	--Message(s)

Batch:-

> Batch is a collection of data. Reduce machine I/O and network I/O. let the producer batch the message.
> With batch send multiple messages in one message and is a internal feature of Kafka.  


Schema:-

> Recommended way to use the message  to be represented as in Some  format. ( JSON or XML ) or use the Avro ( Row oriented system)

Topic:-

> Topic is a logical system write similar messages. It is a group of messages
> Topic is made up of one or more number of partition(s)
> Messages within a topic is always written in sequencial fashion when one partion ( Append only fashion)
> when more than one partition the same will be written in parallel fashion

Partion:-

> Within every partion, FOR EVERY MESSAGE WE GOT A UNIQUE OFFSET-D
> Offset id always start from 0 and i is always incremental.
> We can only increase the partition and cannot delete the partition
> Partioners is the one decide where to keep your messages Default partioner would be using a round robin method to assign the message. 
> Key technical concept used for scalability that keeps Kafka unique from other Pub sub system. 


1) Kafka Broker(s)
	> it is the work horse and more brokers , more storage
  > Data is stored in Kafka Broker.
	> default port number is : 9092
  
ZooKeeper
	> It is nothing but a simple key value store
  > It is service discovery system that can be super fast with reads,writes and updates and also distributed and HA
  > It can also be used as a Metdata manager
	> Default port number is : 2181



> Always start the Zookeeper before the Kafka server. it is      like master server relationship as broker depends on zookeper
